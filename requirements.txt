Explanation of the included libraries:
Flask and Streamlit: Frameworks for creating the web application (Flask for a more customizable API or Streamlit for a faster interface).

Pandas and Numpy: Primary tools for data manipulation.

Scikit-learn and XGBoost: Libraries for training and evaluating machine learning models.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization and result plotting.

JupyterLab and IPython: For interactive notebooks and Python support in the notebooks.

Joblib: For model serialization and saving (useful after training).

Python-dotenv: Useful for managing environment variables during deployment (e.g., API keys, secrets).
